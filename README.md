**About Data**
- Data: This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).
- Data can be downloadd from this link:( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/electric-vehicle-population)

**Task:**
The task is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given dataset. The EDA will serve as the basis for the necessary Data Wrangling activities to be carried out for the purposes of data cleaning and normalization.

**Objective:**
The primary aim of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis of the dataset to identify significant insights.
This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). We set our objective to forumalte a rationale between Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles Population
During the coding process, we will document our observations. Eventually, we will produce a summary and draw conclusions from our findings.
